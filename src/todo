[WORK] load a wav file

[] load an mp2 file https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-2


[] get on Cocoa/macos, no SDL in between
[] get on linux window libraries?
[] get on windows libraries


[] split ednUpdateFrame into ednSimulatePhysics and ednRender?

[] Fix the audio skipping, it is too bad that it skips
	this is probably something to do with not locking in the framerate
	like we should have the physics simulation run on the actual duration
	per frame, although we do our best to lock it in, and do something similar
	with the audio
	To go further, if the frame takes longer than we expect, then we won't have filled
	in the actual amount of audio that is needed

[] the frames look very jerky, why is this?
	maybe moving to 60 fps is the solution? I don't know, movies run at 24 fps, and they look better


[] do the rebuilding and library loading in a separate thread, that way there is no lag
[] Fix the file loading portion of the code
[] Have the loop from a file as the start
