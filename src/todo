[] load a bmp file

[] load a wav file
[] load an mp2 file https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-2

[] do the rebuilding and library loading in a separate thread, that way there is no lag

[] Fix the file loading portion of the code
[] Have the loop from a file as the start

[] split ednUpdateFrame into ednSimulatePhysics and ednRender?
	This should prolly have the OpenGL stuff, right?

[] Fix the audio skipping, it is too bad that it skips

[] the frames look very jerky, why is this?
