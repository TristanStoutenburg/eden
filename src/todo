[WORK] get on OpenGL

[] load a bpm file
[] Have the loop from a file as the start
[] Fix the file loading portion of the code
[] Honestly, getting an image loaded is probably the next thing that I want to have happen... right?
[] Fix the audio skipping, it is too bad that it skips
[] the frames look very jerky, why is this?
