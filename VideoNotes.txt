I'm on Day 8...

So, I'm trying to figure out what to make of this implement your own ring buffer for the audio portion. It's cool stuff.

My problem is that there is the audio callback, which I don't know exactly when that is called, but I'm assuming that it takes
the user audio and passes it off to the second system

The next thing is that there is the copying over for the writing portion of this

so, it kind of makes sense that there are two portions of the buffer:
the part where the play through the write cursor is loaded
The part where new data is buffered into the write cursor


ALSO, there's this weird magic number introduced into the code, which I don't get why the tutorial did that
And, I feel like I don't get why the callback won't ask to get more data than we have, like
SDL determines how much audio it wants, so if it asks for a bunch of stuff, it's going to repeat
which will sound bad, but isn't the worst behavior in the world

And last, this SDL lock audio seems a little odd, like can I just use semaphores? Or some other
concurrency tool? That seems like more fun

Hopefully I can finish number 8 tomorrow!!
